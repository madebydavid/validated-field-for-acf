Add-on field for Advanced Custom Fields that provides input masking and validation.

== Description ==

The Validated Field add-on for [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) provides a wrapper for other 
input types which allows you to provide client side input masking using the jQuery [Masked Input Plugin](http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/), server side validation using either
PHP regular expressions or PHP code, as well as the option of ensuring a field's uniqueness by post type &amp; key, post type, or side wide.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and extract to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure validated fields within the Advanced Custom Fields menus

Please note that this plugin requires [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/).
